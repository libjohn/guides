## RegEx -- an Introduction

* [Slides](slides/)

## Exercise 1 - Find Patterns

### RegEx101

* [RegEx101.com](https://regex101.com/)
* Exercises derived from Intersect Tutorial on Regular Expressions

### Whole words
* *Find all literal words*  
* *Simple searches are just like traditional find & replace*

1. In a separate tab, [open the example RFC text](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2549.txt)
    a. Paste the text into the RegEx101 **Test String** box  
    a. In the Expression box, enter `avian` -- 2 matches  <br>![](http://www.clipular.com/c/6697213840326656.png?k=Sr4JJIBaQIQrFV_e22vdal35gLk) ...  ![](http://www.clipular.com/c/5482778819821568.png?k=0ABAsScKdMlMhm02iRyZaI6HTFo)  
    b. Use `Avian` -- 12 matches  
    c. Use `avian` -- with the **insensitive** case flag -- 14 matches  <br>![](http://www.clipular.com/c/4523633702600704.png?k=2ANfuhKq9-YlXhHskHO6UWvkeZ0) ...   ![](http://www.clipular.com/c/6101324037881856.png?k=6kHKagztUKV9hfLP2f0z64Euk7E) ...  ![](http://www.clipular.com/c/5227111764721664.png?k=J7C2jn8BBj9xTRXVugf8d9K2ui0)  
    d. Clear the **ignore case** flag  

### Capitalization & character classes

[Cheatsheet](http://libjohn.github.io/regex/cheat-sheet.html)

2. **Find only capitalized words**

**Note** *Some characters don't have a literal meaning, these are known as meta characters:  e.g. `"` or `[`
*Note* character classes `[` `]` are denoted by square brackets
*Note* wildcard character is the period: `.`
*Note* multipliers include `*` , `+` , `?`
*Note* Squiggly brackets `{` `}` allow for define repetition
*Note* `\b` is an anchor denoting a word boundary  

     a. `[A-Z]\w*` ![](http://www.clipular.com/c/4898985692102656.png?k=IPiLHHWl3MWUjXTW0gbaLf5j_pY)  
     b. `[A-Z]+` -- match only "all caps" words.  **BUT** this is not quite right.  It doesn't work.  *Do you know why?*  
     c. `\b[A-Z]+\b` -- match on a word boundary using an anchor class:  `\b`  
     d. `\b[A-Z]{2,}\b` -- Abbreviations are usually 2 or more upper case characters.     

### Last word
3. **Match the last words of sentences**<br>
*Note* `\w` is a "word"" character<br>
*Note* `\s` is a "space" character<br>
*Note* `.` is a meta character (introduced above)  
    a. `\w+.` -- This doesn't work because "." matches every character  
    b. `\w+\.` -- We escape the period "." with a the escape character `\`  
    c. `\w+\.\s` -- More precise this time.  Matching on 56 words.  Using `\s` allows us to stop matching email address by matching   whitespace `\s`  

### Numbers
4. **Find all years**<br>
     *Note: the pipe character `|`* for alternation, alternatives* <br>
     *Note: `(` `)` grouping* <br>
     *Note `{` `}` multiplier*  
    a. `\d\d\d\d` -- a lot of matches here  
    b. `\d{4}` -- more succinct but has the same meaning as above  
    c. `\b\d{4}\b` -- word boundaries `\b` help but there are still some false positives  
    d. `\b(19|20)\d\d\b` -- better and works for the twenties and twenty-first centuries   

### Phone numbers  
5. Find a phone number<br> 
*Note: escape the parenthesis `\(`*<br>
*Note: `?` indicates optionality matching zero or one occurrence*  
    a. `\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}` -- Very specific.  This works as long as phone numbers are formatted consistently  
    b. `\(?\d+\)? ?[\d-]{5,}\d` -- more permissive  
    c. `\(?\d+(\)|.)? ?[\d-.]{5,}\d`	   -- more permissive still.  Allows for `.` instead of - as a separator  

### Email addresses  
6. `\w+@[\w\.]+`<br>
*This rule is quite permissive.  It's likely to match some invalid email addresses. e.g. fred@invalid.net* <br>
*It's also likely to miss valid email addresses like vincent.zappa@intersect.org.au* <br>  
**SUGGESTION**: ask the RegEx101 community:  
    a. left-hand sidebar of RegEx101.com  
    b. click *Regex Library*  
    c. search on the term 'email address'  
    d. From there, I found [this pattern](https://regex101.com/library/sI6yF5) <br>   
				Wow!  That saved a lot of time and thinking.<br>

### Section headings
7. *Note* `+` can be applied to a group<br>
*Note* `^` prior to a match pattern means *begins with*<br>
*Note* `$` following a match patterns means *ends with*  
    a. Using the Flag setting of RegEx101 (upper-right), set to multiline	-- This enables ^ and $ anchors  
    b. `^(\w+ ?)+$` -- match repeating words + optional space  
    c. Reset the multiline flag   
    
### Exercise 1

* [Exercise 1](exercise-regex.html)

		
## Exercise 2 - More Patterns

### Get example text

1. [Open Othello text in a browser window](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/othello/full.html) 
2. Paste the text into the RegEx101 **Test String** box

### Alternative spellings & case
3. Turn on the case insensitive flag
4. `honour` -- 14 matches
5. `honou?r` -- optional "u"  and still 14 matches
6. `hon(our|ourable|esty?)` -- honour honourable, honest, honesty; for 66 matches
7. Turn off case insensitive flag -- 61 matches

### Alternative letters and multi-line
8. Turn on multiline matching
9. `^(ACT|SCENE) [IVXLCDM]+` -- literal word, space, roman numerals; for 20 matches
10. Turn off multiline matching  

### Beginning and ending anchors
11. Turn on multiline matching
12. `^[A-Z]+$`
13. Turn off multiline matching

### Punctuation
14. Turn on multiline matching
15. `^.*\?` -- from start of line to question mark
16. Turn off multiline matching  

### Exercise 2

* [Exercise 2](exercise-regex.html)


## Exercise 3 - Replace

### Preparation
1. Generate a small list of random names from the [random name generator](http://listofrandomnames.com/)
2. Click the "List in text area" button, copy and paste the names list to your buffer
3. Replace the text in the RegEx101 **Test String** box with the random names
4. Click the *Substitution* care at the bottom of RegEx101 screen
5. Notice the `$0` code.  

### Capture Groups
6. `(\w+) (\w+)` -- in the *Expression* panel will highlight all names
7. `"$0"` -- in the *Substitution* pane will reproduce the text pattern matched within forward slashes (*Expression* pane `/`     `/`)
8. `- $2, $1` -- swap the order of the first and last name and precede the whole name with a dash '-'
9. `<b>$2</b>, $1` -- Bold the last name and add a coma 

### Exercise 3

* [Exercise 3](exercise-regex.html)


## Exercise 4 - Special case

### Preparation
1. Open this [twitter stream data pre-loaded into RegExr](http://www.regexr.com/3cfee).

*Please note this is actual twitter stream data about a politician, the tweets may be offensive*

You can do this exercise in Regexr.com or copy the textbox data and paste to RegEx101.com

### Capture #hashtags, @twitter-handles
2. `#\w+` -- #hashtag
3. `@\w+` -- @twitter-handle
4. `@[A-Za-z]\w+` -- avoids matching times, e.g. @kairos we're meeting for drinks @10
