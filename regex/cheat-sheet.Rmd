## Character Classes
* `\w`  -  word character
* `\d`  -  digit
* `\s`  -  space
* `\b`  -  word boundary

## Wild card
* `.`  - wild card (matches anything)

## Multipliers
* `?`  - optionality:  0 or 1
* `+`  - one or more
* `*`  - 0 or more
* `{99,99}` -  where 99 is a digit


## Groups and Sets
* `( )` - use with `|` (pipe character) for optionality.  
    + "a or b" = `(a|b)`.  Can use with String Replacement (below)  
* `[ ]` - a range of charcters.  
    + For example characters a through g:  `[a-g]`  
    + characters "L", "C", "I", and "D":  `[CDLI]`


## String Replacement
* `$n`  
    + e.g. `$1`, `$2`
